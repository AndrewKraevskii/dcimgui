[![Build](https://github.com/floooh/dcimgui/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/floooh/dcimgui/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A wrapper repository with code-generated C bindings for Dear ImGui using
the new dear_bindings approach (https://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings).

Uses the `ig` prefix and cimgui.h/cimgui.cpp filenames to be as compatible
as possible with the 'legacy' cimgui bindings.

Includes a matching copy of Dear ImGui, versions are marked via git tags.
